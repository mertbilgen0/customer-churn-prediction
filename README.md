\# Customer Churn Prediction Project



\## Project Goal



This project is designed to help me \*\*develop my skills in data science and machine learning\*\*, by applying newly learned techniques on \*\*real-world data\*\* and observing the results. The focus is on predicting \*\*which customers are likely to churn\*\* from a subscription-based business, allowing me to practice end-to-end data science workflows.



The main objective is to \*\*reinforce my learning\*\* through practical application, from data preprocessing to feature engineering, modeling, and model evaluation.
